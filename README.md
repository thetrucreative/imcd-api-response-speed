Project Name: IMCD API Response Speed

Description:
The IMCD API Response Speed project is designed to enhance the performance of our API endpoints by optimizing the retrieval of API information and dashboard statistics from CloudHub (Mulesoft). This data is then meticulously processed and efficiently stored using OpenSearch, enabling swift and dependable access to pivotal application insights and dashboard statistics. Additionally, the project encompasses a visualization component that presents CPU usage trends over time for diverse applications, offering crucial insights into system performance.

Key Features:
- Streamlines the retrieval of API information and dashboard statistics from CloudHub.
- Utilizes OpenSearch to efficiently store and retrieve processed data.
- Introduces an interactive visualization of CPU usage trends, aiding performance analysis.
- Significantly improves API response speed, contributing to enhanced system performance.

Technologies Used:
- ASP.NET Core for the development of robust API endpoints.
- HttpClient to facilitate seamless HTTP requests to CloudHub services.
- Newtonsoft.Json for the accurate serialization and deserialization of JSON data.
- OpenSearch for the effective indexing and storage of essential data.
- CanvasJS to create dynamic and interactive visualizations of CPU usage trends.

Disclaimer:
This project is not officially endorsed by CloudHub or any third-party APIs referenced within the code.
